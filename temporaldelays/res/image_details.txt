right_detect.png - Generated by model at commit a50df80, shows the first working delayed model set up to detect a single stimuli moving from left to right of a 1D retina. The red spikes in the top raster plot show the response from the second (detection) layer. The bottom is the voltage of neuron 19 (which takes inputs from inputs 2, 3, 4). 
right_detect_left_fail.png - Generated by model at commit a50df80, As above but now stimuli is moving right to left and thus is not detected.

two_dot_right_detect.png - Generate by model at commit eb87f79. Shows the right detector responding only to right motion when there is also left motion.
